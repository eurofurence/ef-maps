# For the KlokanTech Noto fonts as packaged with this repository, the following license applies:

## Noto unicode font for OpenStreetMap & MapBox GL

Manually merged Google Noto fonts (https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to provide glyphs for unicode OpenStreetMap labels in TileServer GL, MapBox GL JS, Android and iOS.

Feel free to use these fonts in your styles on your servers, but you must keep the name of the font as it is in this repository - to credit KlokanTech for the work we have done on merging the Google Noto.

Bugs should be reported under [Issues](https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts/issues) in this repository.

TrueType variant of the fonts for use in MapBox Studio or on desktop can be downloaded too: https://github.com/klokantech/klokantech-gl-fonts/releases/download/v1.0.0/ttf.zip

# Others

The map tiles were created from OpenStreetMap data with a style based on OSM Bright.

Design license: CC-BY 4.0

The visual design features of the style (also known as the "look and feel" of the map) are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

To view a copy of the license, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

Attribution for the design defined in this repository needs not to be provided on map images, but should be reasonably accessible from maps based on this style (for example, in a webpage linked from copyright notice on the map).

Products or services using maps derived from OpenMapTiles schema need to visibly credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to https://openmaptiles.org/.

For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

© OpenMapTiles © OpenStreetMap contributors

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.

Exceptions to OpenMapTiles attribution requirement can be in a written form granted by MapTiler AG (info@maptiler.com).
The project contributors grant MapTiler AG the license to give such exceptions on a commercial basis.
